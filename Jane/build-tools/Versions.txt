Proguard is at version 4.8
JarBundler is at version 2.2.0
Launch4j is at version 3.0.1
Feel free to upgrade these as new versions are released.
If you get the chance, you should replace Launch4j, as it is old and apparently
unmaintained. Also, if they do end up releasing a new version, you need to
combine the mac and windows file structure in order to get it to work on both
platforms.
